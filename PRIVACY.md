# Privacy Policy for NutriScan
Last Updated: May 19, 2025

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how NutriScan ("App") uses your device's camera and handles any related data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## Data Controller Information
NutriScan is provided by Devtejman. We act as the data controller for the processing of image data through Google's Gemini API, though we do not store any user data on our servers.

## Camera Usage
NutriScan requests access to your device's camera solely for the purpose of allowing you to take photos that are processed using Google's Gemini API. This functionality is a core feature of our application that enables analysis of the image content to detect allergens and toxins.

## Data Collection and Processing
**What we do:**
- Allow you to capture photos using your device's camera
- Temporarily process these photos on your device
- Send these photos to Google's Gemini API for analysis
- Display the analysis results back to you within the app
- Use Google Sign-In for authentication purposes, without storing any authentication data on our servers
- Receive basic subscription status information from Google Play to verify your access level
- Show personalized or non-personalized ads through Google AdMob (for non-subscribed users)
- Track the number of daily image scans for free tier users to enforce usage limits

**What we do not:**
- Store any user data on our servers (including photos, analysis results, or authentication data)
- Collect, process, or store any payment information
- Permanently save any photos you take using our application
- Maintain user accounts or profiles on our systems
- Use your photos for any purpose other than the analysis described above
- Share your photos with any third parties beyond Google's Gemini API
- Retain the image data after analysis is complete
- Track your usage patterns or create user profiles beyond what is necessary for app functionality

## Free Tier and Subscription Information
NutriScan offers the following usage tiers:

**Free Tier:**
- Limited to 5 image scans per 24-hour period

- Basic functionality with usage restrictions

**Subscription Tiers:**
- Monthly and annual subscription options available
- 25 image scans per 24-hour period
- Ad-free experience
- Full access to all app features
- Processed through Google Play Billing

Usage limits for free tier users are enforced through temporary, local storage of scan count data on your device. This data is reset every 24 hours and is not transmitted to our servers.

## Subscriptions and Billing
NutriScan offers subscription services that are processed and managed entirely through Google Play Billing. Regarding subscription payments:

- All payment processing is handled by Google Play

- We do not have access to your payment method information
- We receive only subscription status information to verify your access level
- Management of subscriptions, including cancellations and refunds, is handled through Google Play
- Your subscription choices are subject to Google Play's terms and conditions

For questions regarding billing, receipts, refunds, or subscription management, please refer to Google Play's help resources or your Google Play account. Our customer support cannot directly access or modify your billing information.

## Third-Party Services
Our application uses the following third-party services:

1. **Google Sign-In**
   - Used for user authentication
   - Provides a secure way to authenticate without creating or storing accounts on our servers
   - We do not store any Google account information on our servers
   - Your Google Sign-In session is managed entirely on your device and through Google's services

2. **Google's Gemini API**
   - Used to analyze photos taken within the App
   - When you take a photo, it is sent to Google's servers for processing
   - Google acts as a data processor on our behalf
   - The transfer may involve sending data outside the European Economic Area (EEA)

3. **Google Play Billing**
   - Used to process subscription payments (monthly and annual)
   - All payment processing, billing, and subscription management is handled entirely by Google Play
   - We do not collect, store, or process any payment information
   - We receive only basic subscription status information to verify your access level

4. **Google AdMob**
   - Used to display advertisements to non-subscribed users
   - May collect and process certain device information to deliver relevant ads
   - May use cookies or similar technologies for ad personalization
   - All ad-related data processing is handled by Google according to their privacy policies
   - Advertisements are disabled for subscribed users

Google has implemented appropriate safeguards for international data transfers through Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) as approved by the European Commission.

We encourage you to review Google's Privacy Policy at [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for more information about how they handle data, including payment processing, ad serving, and API services.

## Data Retention
Our App follows a strict "zero-storage" approach:

- **Images**: Photos captured in our App are only retained in temporary memory for the duration needed to complete the analysis through Google's Gemini API. Once the analysis is complete, the images are automatically deleted from memory and are never stored on our servers.

- **Analysis Results**: Results are displayed to you immediately after processing but are not stored on our servers. They may be cached temporarily on your device for performance reasons until you close the App or start a new analysis.

- **Authentication Data**: We do not store any Google Sign-In information on our servers. Your authentication session is managed entirely on your device and through Google's services.

- **Usage Limits**: For free tier users, we maintain a local counter on your device to track the number of scans used within a 24-hour period. This counter is stored only on your device and is reset daily.

This zero-storage approach minimizes privacy risks as no user data persists on our systems after you complete your session.

## Your Rights (GDPR and Other Privacy Laws)
Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your data under applicable privacy laws such as the GDPR. Our App is designed with a "zero-storage" model that inherently protects your privacy:

- We do not store your photos
- We do not store analysis results
- We do not store Google Sign-In information
- All data processing is temporary and limited to the duration of your active session

Because we don't store any of your data on our servers, most traditional data subject rights (such as access, rectification, and erasure) do not apply in the conventional sense. There is no stored data for us to provide access to, correct, or delete.

For Google Sign-In:
- You can manage your Google account information and permissions directly through Google's services
- You can revoke our App's access to your Google account at any time through your Google account settings

For AdMob personalized advertising:
- You can adjust your ad preferences through your device settings or Google account
- You can opt-out of personalized advertising through your device's settings

If you have any questions about your privacy rights in relation to our zero-storage approach, please contact us using the information provided in the "Contact Us" section.

## Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)
Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we process your data based on the following legal grounds:
- **Consent**: When you grant permission to access your device's camera
- **Legitimate Interest**: To provide the core functionality of our App (ingredient analysis)
- **Contract**: To fulfill our obligations in providing the service to you, including subscription services

It's important to note that our "zero-storage" approach means that data processing is minimal, temporary, and limited to what is strictly necessary to provide the service.

**Consent Revocation**:
You have the right to withdraw your consent to the collection and use of your personal data at any time.

If you wish to revoke your consent:
Send an email to tmdevsubscriptions@gmail.com with subject Revoke NutriScan Consent.

Once we receive your request, we will:
Remove your account information from Firebase Firestore.
Delete any linked Google Sign-In data associated with your account.
Ensure that logs or reports from Crashlytics are anonymized or deleted where possible.
Stop processing your data with Gemini API for AI-based analysis.
Cancel any active Play Store subscriptions upon request (in line with Play policies).

We will confirm back to you once your data has been deleted or anonymized, typically within 30 days of your request.

## Supervisory Authority (EU)
If you are located in the European Union and believe we are processing your data unlawfully, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection supervisory authority. However, we encourage you to contact us first to discuss your concerns, as our zero-storage approach for NutriScan means that most traditional data privacy concerns are significantly reduced.

## Data Security
We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data during transmission to Google's services, including:
- Encryption of data in transit
- Secure authentication methods
- Regular security assessments

However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security during transmission.

## Children's Privacy
Our App is not intended for use by children under the applicable age of digital consent in your country. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We recommend reviewing this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
